# Nurition Tracker Project for INST377
# 2. Description of your project:
This website is focused on analyzing and presenting nutritional information for recipes submitted by users. It utilizes the Edamam API to generate nutritional analyses, which are then saved into a database and showcased through various methods. These methods include a nutrition label, a bar chart, and a table.

- Nutrition Label: Upon entering a recipe, users receive a nutrition label using the VueNutritionalLabel component. This label offers a breakdown of calories, macros, vitamins, and other nutrients.
- Bar Chart: The website uses a dynamic bar chart that visually displays the distribution of different dish types among the submitted recipes. This chart is created and updated using Chart.js.
- Table: A table is displayed presenting all submitted recipes with key fields like recipe name, calories, dish type, and cuisine type.
